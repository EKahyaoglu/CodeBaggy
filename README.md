# CodeBaggy
The overview of this project website, built with the fundamentals of HTML, is to provide middle school students with an introduction to coding in today's rapidly evolving world.
This would be done by highlighting basic coding resources to get started with and by adding a twist with French Baguette Mascots.

As of October 2023, the project is currently in progress.
